Track inserts to keep t-nuts from falling out of the foil track.  There are different depth and length versions.  The A version seems to work for most tracks.  The B version is for deeper tracks or if you want a more secure fit.  The longer ones can be used to block the entrance of the hole where the t-nuts are inserted.
I used PETG since PETG and ABS seems to hold their springiness longer than PLA or nylon (http://thrinter.com/creep-abs-pla-petg-alloy-910/).  Depending on your track dimensions, some scaling may be needed.
