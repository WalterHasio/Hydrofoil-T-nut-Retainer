# Hydrofoil-T-nut-Retainer
Track inserts to keep t-nuts from falling out of the foil track.  There are different depth and length versions.  The A version seems to work for most tracks.  The B version is for deeper tracks or if you want a more secure fit.  The longer ones can be used to block the entrance of the hole where the t-nuts are inserted.
